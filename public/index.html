          Whether you are a host or guest on websites like Airbnb, HomeAway or VRBO, you probably had to write a review your guests or your host after your experience. Writing reviews has been a critical piece to the success of home-sharing websites, as the community relies on these reviews and ratings to make decisions on where to stay or who to host in their home. As a homeowner, hosting strangers can sometimes be uncomfortable. In order to host travelers in your home or rental unit, you need to make sure that guests are respectful, clean and won’t be damaging your belongings or relationship with your neighbors. This article is meant to cover why writing reviews for your guests matters to much for the home-sharing community.

Sharing our opinions can help all of us to be better guests and better hosts. Always make sure to write accurate review that describe your relationship with your guests.
